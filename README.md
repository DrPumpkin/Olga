<b>What is this?</b><br />
A PGN viewer for Chessgames.com  <br />

<b>What is a PGN viewer?</b><br />
A program that allows users to replay a game of chess.  <br />

<b>What is a PGN viewer?</b><br />
Ember.js, Node.js, Javascript, and MySQL.

<b> Where can I use this? </b><br />
Olga 0.0 was written by Stu and has been de-commissioned.  

Olga 1.0 was written by Christopher Dean, including a full re-write.  It is now the default PGN viewer for Chessgames.com.

Olga 2.0 is being written by Stu, Chris and Daniel Freeman.  

<b>Upcoming Features</b><br />

<b>Bounty List (bugs):</b><br />
• 3 Move repetition reports for the rest of the game

• Piece animation "wiggles" when landing on a destination square, on some platforms in some circumstances.

• No way to alter the speed of "autoplay" mode from mobile phones or tablets. (Desktops can press 1-9, or 0 for lightning-mode.)

• Copying and pasting the game score strips out the spaces (e.g. 1.e4e52.Nf3Nc63.Bb5 etc.)

• Olga chokes on PGN that does not include "x" for captures, e.g. ed5 instead of exd5.

<b>Inspiration:</b><br />
Chessgames.com has been plagued with terrible PGN viewers for years.  PGN4Web and other Java based viewers had no ability to create new variations, and no Stockfish integration.  Olga solves these problems and much more.
